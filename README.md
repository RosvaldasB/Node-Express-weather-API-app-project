<h1> Weather app side project </h1>

Hello, this is a weather app project meant for me to get accustomed to http, back-end, templating and using them to create a project to master learned concepts. 

Technologies used:
<ul>
    <li>Node and Express for backend.</li>
    <li>Axios for HTTP request and working with API's from Unplash and OpenWeatherMap.</li>
    <li>EJS for templating and using gathered data from API's to render them in page.</li>
    <li>EJS for templating and using gathered data from API's to render them in page.</li>
    <li>Passion and aspirations of a growing, motivated developer :>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to work with.</h2>

1. Clone
2. Npm install (contains dotenv, which safekeeps my api keys needed for the project).
3. If you use nodemon, then "nodemon index.js" and in the browser localhost:3000. Else "node index.js" and localhost:3000.

Thank you for checking out, more projects on the way.
